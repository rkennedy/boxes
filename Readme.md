# Boxes

This is a game I wrote in high school and rediscovered while going through some old floppy disks.
I don't know whether it runs anymore because I don't have any 16-bit systems available.
Below is the original readme; it reads as though I released the program, but I don't think I ever actually followed through.

# Readme

This is Boxes v1.0.
It is a program designed in Windows 95 to run in Windows 3.1 or higher.
To play, run Boxes.exe, using the arrow keys to move the blue thing around, moving the gray boxes onto the red goals.
You win when each goal has a box on top of it.

You can use BoxEd to edit your own levels.
Run BoxEd.exe and use the Level menu to choose an action.
The Toolbox window and the Tool menu do the same thing, but once you close the Toolbox, it won't come back until you restart the program.
Change the background pattern in either program using the Options dialog.
You can change the font of the "You Win!" and the "1..2" text by entering a font name in the boxes.ini file.

As one final note, the help menu works, but since there in no Boxes.hlp file in existence, you will get error messages if you choose any of them but About.
The help is the next thing to be written for Boxes, unless you think something else should come first.
